h2. Description

Provides an example Adhearsion component that exposes the Ann Arbor, MI parking lot space availability (<a href="http://www.a2dda.org/parking.php">http://www.a2dda.org/parking.php</a>) via an IVR. This example was expired by the folks @ VoIP Tech Chat and their <a href="http://www.voiptechchat.com/voip/218/use-asterisk-cepstral-and-perl-to-get-parking-and-weather-updates/comment-page-1/">Perl example</a>.

h2. Example

Here is an example for your dialplan.rb:

<pre>
	<code>
		sandbox {
		  #Get an Array of Hashes that contains the parking availability details
		  #by location
		  parking_spaces = fetch_available_spaces

		  #Then build a soundfile from that data to playback to the user
		  menu_soundfile = lot_details(parking_spaces)``

		  #Now lets ask the user for their input
		  lot_selected = input 1,
		                       :timeout => 30.seconds,
		                       :play => menu_soundfile

		  #Now that we have the user selection, lets build the sound file of the 
		  #available spaces
		  if lot_selected != nil
		    spaces_soundfile = spaces_available(parking_spaces, lot_selected)
		    play spaces_soundfile
		  end

		  hangup
		}
    </code>
</pre>
